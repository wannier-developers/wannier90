module w90_types

  !! Definition of types encapsulating various quantities, data and parameters.
  !! Variables are grouped according to physical meaning and their use in the Wannier90 project.
  !!
  !! Here are defined types used by both wannier90.x and postw90.x.
  !! Types specific to wannier90.x (not used by postw90.x) are defined in wannier90_types.F90.
  !! Types specific to postw90.x (not used by wannier90.x) are defined in postw90/postw90_types.F90.
