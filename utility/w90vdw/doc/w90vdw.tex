\chapter*{Calculating van der Waals energies using MLWFs}
\addtocounter {chapter} {1}

\section{Introduction}

This document describes the implementation of a method for calculating
van der Waals energies based on the idea of density decomposition. For
theoretical details, we refer the user to the following publication:\\

Lampros Andrinopoulos, Nicholas D. M. Hine and Arash A. Mostofi,
``Calculating dispersion interactions using maximally localized Wannier functions'',
\emph{J. Chem. Phys.} \textbf{135}, 154105 (2011), hereafter referred
to as ``AHM11''. \\

The code that calculates the van der Waals energy is called
\wvdw\ and should be run separately after a \wannier\ run.\\

Please report comments, bugs or suggestions to the \wannier\ mailing
list.

\section{Compilation}

\wvdw\ does not use any special mathematical libraries and may be
compiled simply using

\begin{verbatim}
$> ifort -o w90vdw.x w90vdw.f90
\end{verbatim}

or equivalent.

\section{Additional parameters in \wannier}

\subsection{$\tt{logical :: write\_vdw\_data}$}

Default value is $\tt{false}$. If $\tt{true}$, then \wannier\ will
write a prototype input file, $\tt{seedname.vdw}$, for
\wvdw.

Dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gamma-only sampling
\item If disentanglement is being used, then $\tt{num\_valance\_bands}$, the
  total number of valence bands in the calculation,
  must be set in $\tt{seedname.win}$.
\item If the system is spin-polarised, then
  $\tt{num\_elec\_per\_state}$, the number of electrons per band/state,
  should be set to $\tt{1}$ in
  $\tt{seedname.win}$. The default value is $\tt{2}$.
\end{itemize}


\section{The \wvdw\ utility}
The \wvdw\ utility can be used to calculate the van der Waals energy
using the centres, spreads and diagonal occupations obtained from
\wannier. This information is written by \wannier\ to
$\tt{seedname.vdw}$ if $\tt{write\_vdw\_data = true}$.

With only a few required modifications by the user (see below),
\wvdw\ reads $\tt{seedname.vdw}$ as an input file and outputs
the vdW energy and $C_{6\rm {eff}}$ of the system in atomic units (Ha
and Ha~a$_0^6$, respectively).

\subsection{Input file}

\wvdw\ reads the input file line by line, so care must be taken with
the ordering of the keywords and values!

The format of the input file is

\begin{verbatim}
disentangle T
amalgamate F
degeneracy  2
num_frag 2
num_wann
 18  18
tol_occ 0.9
pxyz
F F T
F F T
tol_dist 0.05
centres_spreads_occ
ang
 6.8742130670  9.1496672772  7.9865298439  0.5940909695   0.99883400
 5.8247042551  7.3317119345  7.9865426308  0.5941494255   0.99883324
 .
 .
 .
\end{verbatim}

Each line is described in more detail below:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\tt{disentangle}$: logical; allowed values $\tt{T}$ or
  $\tt{F}$; whether MLWFs are disentangled (ie, partially occupied) or
  not
\item $\tt{amalgamate}$: logical; allowed values $\tt{T}$ or
  $\tt{F}$; whether to amalgamate co-centric MLWFs into a single MLWF
  with averaged centre and spread
\item $\tt{degeneracy}$: real; for spin-polarised systems should be 1,
  for spin-degenerate systems 2
\item $\tt{num\_frag}$: integer; the number of molecular fragments in
    the system
\item $\tt{num\_wann}$: the following line contains
  a list of $\tt{num\_frag}$ integers that
  specify the number of MLWFs in each molecular fragment
\item $\tt{tol\_occ}$: real; MLWFs with occupancy less than this value
  will be assumed to be $p$-like atomic orbitals and will be split
  into two separate $s$-like orbitals. Only used if $\tt{disentangle
    T}$.
\item $\tt{pxyz}$: $\tt{num\_frag}$ following lines,
  each on a separate line, that specify the direction in which
  $p$-splitting should be performed for each molecular fragment. Each line
  is a logical vector of length 3. For example,
  ``$\tt{F\ F\ T}$" corresponds to the z-direction; `$\tt{T\ F\ F}$" to the x-direction,
  etc. Only used if $\tt{disentangle
    T}$.
\item $\tt{tol\_dist}$: real; distance threshold (in bohr) determining whether
  MLWFs are co-centric. Only used if $\tt{amalgamate T}$.
\item $\tt{centres\_spreads\_occ}$: the first following line
   specifies the units in which the subsequent entries
  and are specified. Allowed values are $\tt{ang}$,
  $\tt{bohr}$. The next lines, one line for each MLWF,
  specify the Cartesian co-ordinates of the centre, the quadratic
  spread, and the occupancy. \textbf{This data must be ordered by molecular
    fragment, i.e., the MLWFs of the first fragment sequentially grouped together
    first, those of the second fragment grouped next, etc.}
\end{itemize}

While \wannier\ will write the $\tt{seedname.vdw}$ file
automatically, a number of the parameters must checked and modified by hand
prior to running \wvdw. In particular, $\tt{amalgamate}$,
$\tt{num\_frag}$, $\tt{num\_wann}$, $\tt{tol\_occ}$, $\tt{pxyz}$,
  $\tt{tol\_dist}$ and the ordering of the
  $\tt{centres\_spreads\_occ}$ block of data.

The programme is then run simply as

$\tt{\$>}$ \wvdw$\tt{.x}$ $\tt{seedname.vdw}$

and the output is written to a file $\tt{seedname.vdw.out}$.

\section{Example: benzene dimer}

We use the example of a benzene dimer in the ``S''
configuration.

\subsection{Valence (fully occupied) MLWFs}

Directory for files: $\tt{utility/wvdw/examples/benzene\_s\_val/}$

Each benzene molecule has 15 valence MLWFs (see Fig.~8 of AHM11).  The
$\tt{.mmn}$, $\tt{.amn}$, $\tt{.eig}$ and $\tt{.win}$ files are
provided. The $\tt{.mmn}$ file will need to be gunzipped.

First, run

$\tt{\$>}$ \wannier\ $\tt{seedname}$

This will generate $\tt{seedname.vdw}$. Copy this to a new file
$\tt{seedname.in.vdw}$:

$\tt{\$> cp\ seedname.vdw\ seedname.in.vdw}$

and edit $\tt{seedname.in.vdw}$ to ensure that the two molecular
fragments are specified correctly, and to group the data corresponding
to the MLWF centres, spreads and occupancies by molecular fragment.

Then run

$\tt{\$>}$ \wvdw$\tt{.x}$ $\tt{seedname.in.vdw}$

The output is written to a file $\tt{seedname.in.vdw.out}$ and the van der Waals
energy and effective $C_6$ coefficient appears towards the bottom.

Reference output files can be found in  $\tt{utility/wvdw/examples/benzene\_s\_val/ref/}$.

\subsection{Disentangled (partially occupied) MLWFs}

Directory for files: $\tt{utility/wvdw/examples/benzene\_s\_cond/}$

If we now consider higher-lying states (keeping the valence manifold
explicitly included using a frozen window), we may disentangle 18
partially occupied MLWFs per molecule that, unlike the valence-only
case, retain the symmetry of the molecule.

First, run

$\tt{\$>}$ \wannier\ $\tt{seedname}$

This will generate $\tt{seedname.vdw}$. Copy this to a new file
$\tt{seedname.in.vdw}$:

$\tt{\$> cp\ seedname.vdw\ seedname.in.vdw}$

and edit $\tt{seedname.in.vdw}$ to ensure that the two molecular
fragments are specified correctly and to group the data corresponding
to the MLWF centres, spreads and occupancies by molecular fragment.

In addition, as disentanglement is being used, the direction for
$p$-orbital splitting for each fragment and occupancy threshold for
applying the splitting on MLWFs will need to be set appropriately.

The MLWFs centred on the C atoms are of atomic $p$-like character and,
according to the methods described in AHM11, they are split into two
lobes of $s$-like character, which is done by specifying in the input file
the direction in which the $p$-orbital lobes point.

In this particular example, the benzene molecules are in
the $x$-$y$ plane and the $p$-orbitals point along the $z$-direction,
hence this is the direction in which all the $p$-orbitals must be
split. Hence, the lines following $\tt{pxyz}$ in the input file
should read $\tt{F\ F\ T}$.

The orbitals that need to be split are easily identified in
$\tt{seedname.vdw}$ by their occupancies, which will be around
0.5. Hence a value of between 0.6 and 0.9 for $\tt{tol\_occ}$ should
enable the code to apply the splitting algorithms to the $p$-orbitals
and not the others.

Once $\tt{seedname.in.vdw}$ has been correctly modified, run

$\tt{\$>}$ \wvdw$\tt{.x}$ $\tt{seedname.in.vdw}$

As before, the output is written to a file $\tt{seedname.in.vdw.out}$
and the van der Waals energy and effective $C_6$ coefficient appears
towards the bottom.

Reference output files can be found in
$\tt{utility/wvdw/examples/benzene\_s\_cond/ref/}$.


\subsection{Spin polarised systems}

For spin-polarised systems, two separate W90 runs are required for
each spin channel (up/down), so care must be taken with the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item The number of electrons per cell, $\tt{num\_valence\_bands}$,
may differ in the up/down cases.

\item The number of electrons per state, $\tt{num\_elec\_per\_state}$,
has to be set to $\tt{1}$ ($\tt{2}$ is the default value).

\item There will be two input files generated, namely
$\tt{seedname\_up.vdw}$ and $\tt{seedname\_dn.vdw}$.
These have to be merged into one input file for the
vdW utility, and the centres sorted by fragment as before.

\item The $\tt{amalgamate}$ keyword in the input file has to be set
to $\tt{T}$ so that cocentric MLWFs are amalgamated into one.

\item The number of MLWFs per fragment, $\tt{num\_wann}$, should
be changed in the input file to the original number of MLWFs used
in Wannier90 for both up/down calculations.
\end{itemize}
