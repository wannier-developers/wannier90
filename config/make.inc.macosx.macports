#=================================================
# For Mac Os X (tested on 10.10 Yosemite)
#=================================================
## The following requires a working gfortran compiler.
## You can use for instance MacPorts to obtain it
## (http://www.macports.org/).
## After installation and configuration of MacPorts,
## install a recent version of gcc to get (also)
## gfortran.
## For instance:
##  sudo port install gcc5
## Note: update version number in port and F90 below as necessary
##
F90 = gfortran-mp-5
CC = cc


## The next two lines are needed if you want a
## parallel version of postw90.x. If you are OK
## with a serial version, simply comment the next
## two lines.
## To get openmpi with MacPorts, use for instance
##  sudo port install openmpi-default
## Note that with MacPorts, the 
## 'mpirun' executable needed to run the code
## is called 'mpirun-openmpirun-mp'
## (You could also use mpich instead of openmpi.)
##
COMMS=mpi
MPIF90=mpif90-openmpi-mp



## IMPORTANT!! the -ff2c is needed if one wants to
## use the BLAS and LAPACK libraries shipped with
## Apple Mac OS X (using -framework Accelerate).
## (at least on recent Mac OS X versions).
## This is beacause some routines (as ZDOTC) in the
## libraries provided by Apple are compiled with the
## C interface instead of the Fortran interface.
## Instead, remove the -ff2c flags (both from FCOPTS
## and from LDOPTS) if you have downloaded and 
## compiled the BLAS and LAPACK libraries from netlib.org.
##
## IF YOU DON'T DO THE CORRECT THING, THE CODE COMPILES BUT
## THEN EITHER CRASHES OR GIVES WRONG RESULTS!
##
## THUS: ALWAYS TRY AT LEAST THE PROVIDED TEST EXAMPLES
## TO SEE IF YOUR EXECUTABLE IS PROVIDING SENSIBLE RESULTS!
## (i.e.: run
##  make test
## and then compare the results)
FCOPTS=-O2 -ff2c
LDOPTS=-O2 -ff2c
LIBS   =  -framework Accelerate

# other options: do not use -ff2c but instead:
# port vecLibfort (wrapper to Accelerate): LIBS = -L/opt/local/lib -lvecLibFort
# port atlas: LIBS = -L/opt/local/lib -lsatlas
# port openblas +lapack: LIBS = -L/opt/local/lib -lopenblas
