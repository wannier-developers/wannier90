# For Mac Os X (tested on 10.12 Sierra)
#=================================================
## The following requires a working gfortran compiler.
## You can use for instance HomeBrew to obtain it
## (https://brew.sh).
## After installation and configuration of HomeBrew,
## install a recent version of gcc to get (also)
## gfortran.
## For instance:
##  brew install gcc
F90 = gfortran
CC = cc


## The next two lines are needed if you want a
## parallel version of postw90.x. If you are OK
## with a serial version, simply comment the next
## two lines.
## To get openmpi with HomeBrew, use for instance
##  brew install openmpi
COMMS=mpi
MPIF90=mpifort

## Note: we could use -framework Accelerate, but we should
## then compile with the -ff2c option to gfortran to use
## C-style conventions for functions returning complex values -
## otherwise, we get sigsev... however, -ff2c is not compatible
## with openmpi from brew!!! (at least on March 2017). 
## This is because -ff2c implies -fsecond-underscore
## (see https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Code-Gen-Options.html)
## 
## Therefore, you need first to install blas/lapack libraries from
##  brew install homebrew/science/openblas
## and then use the following options
FCOPTS=-O2 
LDOPTS=-O2 
LIBS   = -L/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib -lblas -llapack
