In s_at_0.25, we use an additional flag "read_sym = .true." to customize the symmetry operations to be used.  
We exclude the inversion symmetry to create s-like Wannier function centered at (1/4,1/4,1/4). 
Information on symmetry operations without inversion symmetry is taken from GaAs calculation.
