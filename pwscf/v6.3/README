This folder contains two version of pw2wannier90.f90:
a standard version and a legacy version.
The reason is the following: in Wannier90 v3.0 some flags
controlling the automatic generation of the initial 
projections were moved from the Wannier90 input to the
pw2wannier90 input. 
The legacy version is compatible with v6.3 of QE and
previous versions of Wannier90 containing the SCDM method 
(between 2.1 and 3.0). If using this version of pw2wannier90
you must specify the SCDM flags into the Wannier90 input.
The standard version is compatible with changes in v3.0 of 
Wannier90 and QE v6.3. If using this version of pw2wannier90
you must specify the SCDM flags into the pw2wannier90 input
and you also need to add auto_projections = .true. in the
Wannier90 input file.
