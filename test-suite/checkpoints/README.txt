This folder contains a number of checkpoints that have been generated by Wannier90
(and then converted in formatted format with 'w90chk2chk.x -u2f', and finally bzipped).

They are collected here so that multiple tests can use the same checkpoints avoiding duplication of data (files can potentially be big).

Files should be stored in different folders, with all the files to generate them again
(in case in the future we need to change the .chk format and we need to regenerate them).

You can copy the Makefile to help you regenerate the chk.fmt.bz2 file, if needed. In principle, if you have only one .win file in the folder, you just need to copy the file and type make, with no modifications to the Makefile.
