\chapter{Other thoughts}

We need a good user guide with a range of examples.

We need a comprehensive set of test cases. Initially to check that the new
and old codes give the same answers. Later on so we can check the code is
working correctly when porting to new platforms and making new releases.

A CVS (or subversion) repository would be very useful. Particularly when
adding new features (ie one can have a release version and a development
version). This would need to be on a networked machine and ideally one
with a good back-up scheme.

A mailing list (with web archive) would be nice. Could the pwscf crowd
provide this for us?

If the code is to released under the GPL, we have to be sure that all of
the code complies with the GPL. At the moment it doesn't. For example
there are a few routines cut and pasted from Numerical Recipes. (we can
recode the same methods, but a cut and paste is not ok).

The code will need LAPACK, BLAS and FFT libraries. While some systems
package these with the compilers other don't (such as g95). We don't use
very many routines from these libraries so we 
might be able to package them in with the wannier code; for those that
don't want the hassle 
of making their own libraries. Pwscf does this.
